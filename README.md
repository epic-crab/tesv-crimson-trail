# crimson-trail
 
Crimson Trail is a Creation Club integration mod focusing on the Alternate Armors creations. Each of the Alternate Armors creations comes with a quest that has you hunt down a bandit and kill them for their armor. Each bandit was at one time a member of a gang called the Crimson Dirks. The mod creates an umbrella quest to give you a reason to track down the bandits for a bounty, triggering each CC quest at a reasonable time with context, instead of dropping all of them on you simultaneously when you start the game and leaving you wondering if these people were meant to be someone important.
All Creation Club armors have been added to vanilla leveled lists at appropriate levels. Stats have been rebalanced such that the alternate armors are no longer the best item in the game.
This mod replaces the Unofficial Creation Club Patches for these files.
